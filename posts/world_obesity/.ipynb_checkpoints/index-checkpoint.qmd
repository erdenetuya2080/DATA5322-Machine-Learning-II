## ABSTRACT

Obesity is one of the major health problems affecting the world's population. Obesity is also known as the silent epidemic. According to research, by 2024, approximately one billion people in the world will be obese, including 880 million adults. This research uses unsupervised learning methods, including PCA and clustering, to combine global obesity prevalence data and World Bank development indicators to group countries based on the pattern of obesity in adults. The results of the study showed that a country's health expenditure and gross domestic product are strongly correlated with obesity rates.


## INTRODUCTION

The global obesity rate is increasing every year, and this is due to many factors. This study aims to explore adult obesity trends across different countries by examining their relationship with key national indicators such as Gross Domestic Product, health expenditure, literacy rate, and the level of urban population. By applying unsupervised learning techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction and K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering for pattern recognition, this research seeks to identify meaningful groupings of countries with similar obesity profiles. The goal is to uncover latent structures in the data that may inform future research and policy decisions aimed at reducing obesity worldwide.

## THEORICAL BACKGROUND

This study analyzes global obesity trends through unsupervised learning techniques, emphasizing their operational mechanisms, practical applications, parameter tuning, evaluation metrics, and inherent limitations.

**1. Standardization**

Before applying any modeling techniques, all numeric features were standardized using StandardScaler. This step is crucial when working with variables on different scales—such as GDP per capita and obesity percentages—as many clustering and dimensionality reduction methods are sensitive to scale. Standardization helps that each feature contributes equally to the analysis.

**2. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a useful method for breaking down a matrix into smaller parts to better understand the data. It helps reduce the number of variables while keeping the important patterns. SVD is especially helpful when working with large datasets, missing values, or when we want to simplify the data without losing too much accuracy. The SVD is widely used in unsupervised learning.

**3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a method used to simplify large datasets by reducing the number of variables while keeping the most important information. It does this by creating new variables, called principal components, that capture the main patterns in the data. PCA is useful for making data easier to visualize, removing noise, and preparing for other analyses.

**4. K-Means Clustering**

K-Means is a simple yet powerful clustering algorithm that groups data points into a specified number of clusters based on similarity. It works by minimizing the distance between data points and the center of their assigned cluster, making it efficient for large datasets. K-Means is widely used in unsupervised learning to uncover hidden patterns and groupings in data. Cluster quality was evaluated using:
    - Silhouette score measures how similar each data point is to its own cluster versus other clusters.
    - Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WSS) helps identify the optimal number of clusters.
    - A confusion matrix shows how the cluster labels assigned by K-Means match up with the true class labels. It helps evaluate how well the clusters correspond to known categories.

**5. Hierarchical Clustering**

Hierarchical clustering creates a dendrogram (tree-like structure) to show how data points can be grouped. It does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance. Two types were used:
•	Agglomerative (bottom-up) approach with four linkage methods:
    - Single --> min distance
    - Complete --> max distance
    - Average --> mean distance
    - Ward --> minimizes total variance
Dendrograms were used to visually cut the hierarchy into a specified number of clusters. 

**6. Scaled vs Unscaled Clustering**

The effect of feature scaling was assessed by running hierarchical clustering on both standardized and unscaled datasets. Differences in cluster assignments showed the importance of scaling, especially when using distance-based methods like hierarchical clustering.

**7. Evaluation Metrics**

To assess and compare the models:
    - MSE and correlation were used to evaluate SVD-based imputation.
    - Silhouette score and Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WSS) used for K-Means performance.
    - Confusion matrices were used to compare clustering outcomes with continent groupings and binary obesity class labels.

## METHODOLOGY

**Dataset Overview**

This study combined two datasets to investigate obesity patterns across countries. The first dataset contained adult obesity statistics, including overweight and obesity prevalence for males, females, and the general adult population. The second dataset came from the World Bank and included development indicators such as health expenditure per capita, GDP per capita, literacy rate, physician density, and urban population percentage.

**Data Cleaning and Merging**

The obesity dataset was filtered to include only adult entries by selecting rows where the age group began with “18.” Columns with numeric values were cleaned by replacing commas with periods and converting them to float type. The year column was standardized by extracting the four-digit year. Missing values were removed to ensure complete observations. The World Bank dataset was reshaped from wide to long format and then pivoted to transform each indicator into its own column. We selected the most recent year of data available for each country and merged the datasets using country names as the key. The resulting dataset included 51 countries with 13 relevant numeric features.

**Standardization of Features**

All numeric features in the final dataset were standardized StandardScaler. This ensured equal weighting across variables with different units and scales, such as obesity percentages and GDP values, which is important for distance-based methods like clustering.

**Dimensionality Reduction with SVD**

To explore the internal structure of the data and simulate recovery from missing information, we applied SVD. We created versions of the dataset with random missing values at rates ranging from 5% to 30%. For each version, we performed low-rank SVD matrix completion using ranks from 1 to 5. The imputed values were compared against the original values at missing positions using mean squared error (MSE) and Pearson correlation.

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the standardized dataset to reduce dimensionality and visualize the structure of the data. PCA was applied to obtain the principal components and the proportion of variance explained by each. A cumulative variance by scree plot was generated to determine how many components were sufficient to capture the majority of the dataset’s information. A two-dimensional projection based on the top principal components was also created for visualization.

**K-Means Clustering and Evaluation**

We applied K-Means clustering to the standardized dataset to identify groups of countries with similar health and development profiles. Clusters were generated for values of k ranging from 2 to 10. To evaluate the clustering quality, we computed within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) and silhouette scores. Cluster centroids were extracted and inverse-transformed to interpret them in the original data scale. A binary obesity class was created based on whether adult obesity rates were above or below 30%, and a confusion matrix was constructed to compare this class to the K-Means cluster assignments.

**Hierarchical Clustering with Multiple Linkage Methods**

We performed hierarchical clustering on a random sample of 40 countries using four linkage methods: complete, average, single, and Ward. Clustering was based on selected features including adult obesity, GDP per capita, and health expenditure. Linkage matrices were generated for each method, and dendrograms were plotted to visualize cluster formation. The number of clusters was selected by cutting the dendrogram at a fixed height. Cluster memberships were recorded for further comparison.

**Comparison of Scaled vs Unscaled Clustering**

To examine the effect of feature scaling on hierarchical clustering, we repeated the clustering process using both scaled and unscaled data. Cluster labels from each version were compared to determine if standardization impacted the grouping of countries.

**Comparison of Continent and Obesity Class**

We evaluated how well the clustering matched the known regional groupings by comparing cluster labels to continent labels. Continent information was mapped manually to each country. A binary “obese class” variable was also defined, and clustering outputs were compared against this using confusion matrices.

**Performance Metrics**

To assess the models and methods used in this project, we employed several evaluation metrics: mean squared error (MSE) and Pearson correlation for matrix completion, silhouette scores for K-Means clustering quality, and confusion matrices for comparing cluster labels to continent and obesity class labels. These metrics helped guide hyperparameter choices and supported comparison between different methods.

## RESULT

The computational results for PCA, SVD, and Clustering are presented below. The performance of the results was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), correlation, Silhouette score, and confusion matrix. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of how well the methods cluster adult obesity based on socioeconomic and health-related indicators, including health expenditure per capita, GDP per capita, literacy rate, physician density, and urban population percentage across 51 countries.
