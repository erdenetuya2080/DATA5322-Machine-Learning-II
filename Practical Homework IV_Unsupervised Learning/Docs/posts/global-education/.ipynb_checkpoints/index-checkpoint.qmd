## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

Education plays a vital role in shaping a countryâ€™s future. Governments around the world invest in education at varying levels, which may influence literacy rates, student enrollment, and long-term development. In this blog post, we use unsupervised learning to explore patterns in education spending and related outcomes across countries.

## ðŸ§¹ Methodology and Data Cleaning

The analysis merges datasets from the World Bank and other sources. The key steps included:

- Merging education spending and literacy data with GDP and population figures
- Removing rows with excessive missing values
- Standardizing numeric columns using z-scores

```{python}
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

features = ["Education_Spending", "Literacy_Rate", "GDP_Per_Capita"]
X = df[features].dropna()
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
